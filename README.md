# Update-Text
A way to get information stored in column list format in text files.


This program works with a text file filled with information in columns. It sorts by the first column first (star name in my case). Then prints the information for that star. You are given the option to update in most cases, sometimes append. 

The file will currently write a new file, and not replace the old.
